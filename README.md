🔐 EchoGuard – Android App Permission Monitoring System

EchoGuard is an Android privacy and security application that helps users monitor, analyze, and control app permissions in real time. It protects users from hidden privacy risks by identifying suspicious permission usage and giving them full control over their data.

📌 Problem Statement

Many Android apps request sensitive permissions such as:

Microphone

Camera

Location

Storage

Contacts

Often, these permissions are misused or accessed in the background without the user’s awareness. Existing permission managers are mostly static and do not explain how or when permissions are used.

💡 Solution – EchoGuard

EchoGuard provides a smart, centralized permission monitoring system that:

Tracks permission usage across all installed apps

Detects unusual or risky behavior

Notifies users in real time

Allows instant permission control from one dashboard

✨ Key Features

🔍 Real-Time Permission Monitoring
Continuously monitors which app is accessing which permission and when.

⚠️ Suspicious Activity Detection
Flags abnormal behaviors such as:

Background access to microphone or camera

Apps requesting permissions unrelated to their functionality

🔔 Instant Alerts
Notifies users whenever a sensitive permission is accessed unexpectedly.

🛑 One-Tap Permission Control
Easily revoke, restrict, or allow permissions directly from the app.

📊 Privacy Risk Score
Each app is assigned a risk score based on permission usage patterns.

🔐 Privacy-First Design
User data is handled securely and transparently.

🧠 How It Works

EchoGuard scans installed apps and their permissions

It monitors permission usage in real time

Behavioral analysis identifies risky patterns

Alerts are triggered for suspicious activity

Users take action instantly from the dashboard
