# 🔐 EchoGuard  
### Android App Permission Monitoring & Privacy Protection System

> **EchoGuard** helps Android users **monitor, analyze, and control app permissions in real time**, protecting their privacy from hidden and suspicious app behavior.

---

## 🚀 Why EchoGuard?

Modern Android apps often access sensitive permissions like **microphone, camera, location, and storage** — sometimes without clear user awareness.

EchoGuard exists to **bring transparency, awareness, and control** back to users.
